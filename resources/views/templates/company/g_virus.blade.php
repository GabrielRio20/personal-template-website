    The Golgotha Virus, abbreviated as G-Virus, is a retrovirus in the Progenitor family of viruses. Golgotha was developed by Umbrella USA as a bioweapon to rival and surpass Tyrant Virus ("t-Virus"). The two viruses, while being descended from Progenitor, are totally dissimilar. <br><br>
    Whereas t-Virus typically causes relatively minor mutations in human hosts, like Zombies and Tyrants, Golgotha causes such extreme genetic mutations that victims are no longer recognizable as human. Human t-Virus mutants are almost unanimously infertile, while Golgotha's "G" mutants are highly-fertile and asexually reproductive. t-Virus causes necrosis of the body as a side-effect, while Golgotha is capable of repairing dead cells, and even reviving the dead. Because of these factors, the Golgotha is regarded as one of the greatest threats to the planet if an outbreak were to occur. <br> <br>

    Golgotha was isolated in 1988 by Dr. William Birkin, the chief researcher at Umbrella USA's top-secret Arklay Laboratory. Found in the body of Lisa Trevor, a human test subject, its discovery was made following her immune system's inexplicable destruction of an NE Type parasite, and could theoretically have existed since the late 1960s when testing on her began. As Golgotha was determined to be able to genetically alter a living being repeatedly and unpredictably as well as be able to repair damaged cells and revive the dead, it ran counter to Umbrella's plans to create a reliable military-grade B.O.W.s that could be controlled by Army trainers. <br><br>
    Umbrella Pharmaceuticals' CEO, Dr. Oswell E. Spencer, Earl Spencer, was nonetheless interested in Golgotha for its potential eugenics purposes, and authorized development as an R&D project unrelated to the t-Virus Project. Early research on Golgotha took place in France at an underground research complex led by Dr. Christine Henry, a French countess from a family connected to Dr. Spencer. This partnership ceased in 1991 with the completion of NEST within a limestone cavern in the outskirts of Raccoon City.
