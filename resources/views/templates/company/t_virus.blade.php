<p style="text-align:justify">
Tyrant Virus, otherwise known as the t-Virus, is the general name given to a series of mutant Progenitor virus strains. <br><br>

Initially developed by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals in the late 1960s, the primary goal of the "t-Virus Project" was to effectively eliminate the need for a large-scale conventional army and generate revenue to go to their eugenics program, the Wesker Project. This required two things: the virus had to be highly-contagious to the point of infecting an entire target population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate. Such a virus was impossible due to such contagions' tendencies to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread. <br><br>

By 1978, development moved from creating a lethal, highly-contagious virus to one that would mutate hosts to become physically stronger and remain alive despite organ failures and severe brain damage, the latter leading to murderous aggression and an obsessive hunger to the state of cannibalism. With the 1981 discovery of a statistical 10% of any population being naturally immune or unmutated asymptomatic carriers, Phase 2 of the research project focused on creating workarounds, and while work was under way creating an improved t-Virus with 0% immunity, the pioneering Arklay Laboratory team under Dr. William Birkin engineered a new species of animal that would hunt down and kill survivors, beginning with simple Bio-Organic Weapons such as the Web Spinner, but breaking ground with the genetically-chimeric Hunter. <br><br>

In the mid-1980s, the t-Virus Project focused on creating intelligent bio-weapons, most famously the Tyrants. After the collapse of Umbrella in the early 2000s, the t-Virus became available to dozens of organizations with the means to finalize Umbrella's research in their own way and dominate the weapon industry. Independently developed mutagens such as t-Abyss were developed thanks to this.
